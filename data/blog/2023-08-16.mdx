<p><a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-IP-restrictions">IP restrictions for passwords</a> is the type of security feature that gets buried on Product’s roadmap, is boring for Engineering to implement, and could became the bane of Support. </p>



<p>But Sales claims that they can’t close enterprise deals unless the product supports this. They say, “yeah, <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-boost-now-available">Boost is cool</a>, but the architect at Walmart won’t approve a sale unless the shiny database has the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview">access restrictions they’re used to on Azure</a>”.</p>



<p>Over at Planetscale it looks like Sales won a battle.</p>
