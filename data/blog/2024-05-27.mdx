<p></p>



<p>There is no AI mentioned in this week's newsletter. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/please-clap">Please clap</a>.</p>



<p>And let's get into it... </p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>Young serverless PostgreSQL startup <strong>Tembo</strong> made a bold move with their product launch last week. <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pg-timeseries">They released pg_timeseries</a>, a Postgres plugin that enables developers to work with timeseries data. (Think: weather data, server metrics, sensor data, ect) </p>



<p>Why is this audacious? </p>



<p>There's already an entire startup that specializes in using Postgres for timeseries data called "<a href="https://www.timescale.com/">Timescale</a>". And Timescale allows developers to use their open source <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb">timescaledb plugin</a> in databases, without using their SaaS product.</p>



<p>However, the timescaledb plugin is under a <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-we-are-building-a-self-sustaining-open-source-business-in-the-cloud-era/amp/">Cloud Protection License</a>. This means you can use it for any purpose, except offering a SaaS database product. This prevents a company like AWS from <em><a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252455700/AWS-pushes-Mongo-DB-compatible-alternative-as-licences-change">Mongo-ing</a></em> Timescale and competing with them.</p>



<p>Up until now this has prevented Postgres platforms like Supabase, Xata, and Neon from offering services using timescaledb. However, individual users were free to install it in their individual databases.</p>



<p>Tembo's permissively licensed, alternative timeseries plugin changes the landscape. Now they and anyone else can compete with Timescale's services.</p>



<p>For making a bossed up move like that, Tembo's pg_timescale is your Product Launch of the Week.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Other Launches</h2>



<p>✨ Front-end cloud platform, <strong>Vercel</strong> had a launch event, and released several new features, including a <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-the-vercel-waf">web application firewall</a>. Read about <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-ship-2024">everything else Vercel shipped</a>.</p>



<p>✨ Platform-as-a-service, <strong>Heroku</strong> now has <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/heroku-postgres-essential-launch">a low tier database plan</a> that starts at just $5. </p>



<p>In 2022 Heroku <a href="https://thenewstack.io/where-can-heroku-free-tier-users-go/">nixed its free tier plan</a> which sparked a migration of small projects off of the platform, and to services like Render. <a href="https://render.com/blog/knative">See this chart</a> where Render's growth skyrockets post-Heroku's sunset announcement.</p>



<p>Perhaps Heroku is trying to win hobbyists back with a cheap database plan.</p>



<p>✨ Headless CMS, <strong>Hygraph</strong> wrote up <a href="https://hygraph.com/blog/headless-cms-example">the 8 key use cases</a> for their product. This isn't a product launch, but I want to highlight how simple and smart this is. Customers need to be told explicitly what a developer tool can be used for, or they'll likely slot it into the wrong categories.</p>



<p>The only tweak I would make to this content is to not format it as an article. This should be a series of pages on the Hypgraph site so it can easliy be discovered by prospects.</p>



<p>✨ CDN for APIs, <strong>Stellate</strong> <a href="https://stellate.co/blog/pqc-plus-defer">launched an improvement to caching</a>. This updated feature enables developers to "immediately return cached content to the client and use @defer to return uncacheable content when it’s resolved by the origin".</p>
