<p>This has been a jam-packed week in developer tooling! If you're in Product or Marketing, there are lots of launches you can learn, and strategic moves you can copy or counter.</p>



<p>Let's get into it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-tertiary-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>Competition in the serverless database space reminds me of the red hot front-end framework wars from 2017-2021. Every month there was a new competitor with a different angle on building a UI.<br><br>Nile just entered the market with a focus on multi-tenant apps, making it easy for fullstack developers to spin up a SaaS. The product's unique value prop is interesting because it may solve an advanced problem that is not the starting use case for choosing a serverless database. <br><br>I think Nile's founders know this, which is why last week they launched templates, with step-by-step tutorials and walk-thru videos. </p>



<p>Building starter projects is usually an after-thought for Product teams, and can often be handled in a haphazard way by DevRel. But in my experience, nothing attracts conversion and activations like a well done template that demonstrates the tool's common use case.</p>
