<p class="has-base-color has-contrast-2-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-medium-font-size">"<strong>Devtools Weekly</strong>" by <a href="https://hypeburner.com">Hypeburner</a> tracks the business of developer tools. I'm your editor, Hashim Warren.</p>



<p>This was a busy week, and there were multiple launches this week that could have taken the "Hot Product Launch" spot. </p>



<p>Let's get into it...</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p><strong>OpenAI</strong> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/whats-new">revealed v2 of their Assistants API</a>. The updated API gives developers the ability to do "retrieval augmented generation" (RAG) without using third-party tools.</p>



<p>Some are saying OpenAI just knocked over the bird's nest of RAG startups in their incubation stage. This includes LLM orchestrators like <strong>Langchain</strong> and <strong>LlamaIndex</strong>, and vector databases like...there are too many to list. </p>



<p>That take is short-sighted. When a popular platform launches its own tools it typically just validates the need and market. It doesn't wipe out competition.</p>



<p>For example, <strong>Terraform</strong> usage is surging as a third-party cloud infra tool, despite competing tools maintained by AWS.  </p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>Hyepburner's "Enterprise Watch" is a weekly trophy üèÜ to startups that release features large companies may care about and pay for.</p>



<p>The nod this week goes to testing tool, <strong>Cypress</strong> with its <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2024/04/18/new-enterprise-reporting">new org wide reporting features</a>. </p>



<p>It's remarkable that Cypress is almost 10 years old and only now has this C-suite friendly feature. No matter how long it took, I love seeing this tool make a "pivot to profitability". </p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Product Launches</h2>



<p>‚ú® SaaS database, <strong>Supabase</strong> <a href="https://supabase.com/ga">rolled out the general availability</a> of its product after four years in beta. The company also announced an acquisition of <a href="https://www.orioledb.com/">Postgres tool Oriole</a>, and that over 1 million databases have been made on the Supabase service.  </p>



<p>‚ú® <strong>Neon</strong>, a competitor to Supabase <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/neon-ga">also went GA the same day</a>. Neon announced 700,000 databases on the service. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-contrast-3-background-color has-background">üìù<strong> I'm writing a special report on serverless Postgres databases, which will profile the go-to-market tactics of Supabase, Neon, and more. Keep watching your inbox for a notification of its release.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>‚ú® Headless CMS, <strong>Contentful</strong> <a href="https://www.contentful.com/blog/contentful-studio/">launched "Contentful Studio"</a>. Contentful Studio is a visual collaboration tool, which is the holy grail for every CMS.</p>



<p>‚ú®Devops platform, <strong>Gitlab</strong> <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/04/18/gitlab-duo-chat-now-generally-available/">rolled out Duo Chat</a>, an AI tool that helps with code explanation, refactoring, and test generation.</p>



<p>üí° Here's something to emulate: <strong>Gitlab</strong> ran a "<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/#ai">state of AI in software development</a>" survey and received a ton of earned media from outlets writing about the report. How can you pair original research with upcoming launches to gain PR?</p>



<p>‚ú® Development platform, <strong>Render</strong> released "<a href="https://docs.render.com/projects#protected-access">protected environments</a>". This ensures that "only admins can perform potentially destructive actions on a protected environment, such as deleting services or modifying environment variables."</p>



<p>I almost gave Render the "Enterprise Watch" üèÜ trophy because of this feature. It's great to see two candidates for the award in the same week.</p>
