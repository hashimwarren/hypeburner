<p>Yes, I watched the OpenAI announcement. No, it won't be covered in this newsletter. </p>



<p>C'mon, their "dev day" was 90% for consumers. However, I also watched GitHub Universe, and all of GitHub's new features are based on OpenAI tech. So two birds, one stone.</p>



<p>Let's get into it...</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>GitHub Universe, GitHub annual developer conference announced a lot of new initiatives, mostly focused on AI. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tech press coverage missed the most impactful new feature GitHub demo'd - <em>integrations with third-party services through AI chat</em>.</p>



<p>Here are three exciting use cases GitHub highlighted:</p>



<ul>
<li>Check the status of a feature flag, using LaunchDarkly</li>



<li>Ask Postman if you're using an API correctly</li>



<li>Check the status of a database using Datastax</li>
</ul>



<p>ðŸ”® Prediction:<br>Today GitHub Copilot promises to help with the consumption of third-party services. But expect <em>discovery</em>, <em>evaluation</em>, <em>procurement</em>, and <em>customer service</em> for devtool services to come next. Trust me - that <a href="https://myoctocat.com/">Octocat</a> will want its tentacles in everything!</p>



<p>Participants in GitHub Copilot's Partner Program: <br>Pulumi, Plotly, Swimm, ReadMe, Gretel, HashiCorp, NowSecure, Split, Microsoft (duh), Trunk, Evinced, Astronomer, Honeycomb, Endor Labs, Octopus Deploy, RedHat, Postman, Databricks, Sentry, Docker, New Relic, Crunch, Datastax, LaunchDarkly, Tricentis, Datadog </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Backend Products</h2>



<p>âœ¨  Grafbase, the GraphQL API gateway released <a href="https://grafbase.com/blog/introducing-the-grafbase-postgres-connector">a Postgres connector</a>. This makes Grafbase easier to use with serverless databases based on Postgres, such as Supabase, Neon, and Railway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>I noticed that for a second year in a row, Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">received a shout out at GitHub Universe</a> for its hockey stick growth in project repos.<br><br>That's great, but is Hashicorp translating open-source usage of HCL and Terraform into sales?</p>



<p>Hashicorp makes it into Enterprise Watch because on top of the announcement of Terraform's test suite a few weeks ago, they've now released red meat for the Sales team pushing Terraform Enterprise:<br></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/settings/deletion#automatically-destroy">Ephemeral workspaces</a> - "set timeouts that automatically destroy temporary resources"</li>



<li><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-cloud-now-supports-multiple-configurations-for-dynamic-provider-credent">Multiple dynamic provider configurations</a> - "enable workspace admins to authenticate multiple aliases of the same provider within a single workspace when provisioning infrastructure"</li>



<li>Run data retention - "provides a configurable data retention policy for Terraform run data"</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Front-End Products</h2>



<p>âœ¨ Javascript framework Angular made a splash with a new product direction and new logo to signify a break with the past. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6GpTZ7AX0">Watch the team</a> announce the new features.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">DevOps Products</h2>



<p>âœ¨ Congrats to the Tabnine <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/blog/tabnine-series-b/">team on a $25 million series B</a>! Here's how Tabnine <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/blog/github-copilot-vs-chatgpt-what-organizations-should-know/">differentiates the tool from GitHub Copilot</a>.</p>



<p>âœ¨ Testing tool Cypress and Currents.dev are <a href="https://twitter.com/agoldis/status/1722278326004597075">knife fighting in public</a>. Here's the side of the story <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2023/11/07/update-defense-intellectual-property">from Currents</a>, and here's the <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2023/11/07/update-defense-intellectual-property">clapback from Cypress</a>. The bigger issue is what should an open-source startup do when a new startup builds a competitive SaaS based on the free project?</p>
