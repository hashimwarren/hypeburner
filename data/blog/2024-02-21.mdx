<p class="has-base-color has-contrast-2-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-medium-font-size">"<strong>Devtools Weekly</strong>" by <a href="/">Hypeburner</a> tracks the business of developer tools. I'm your editor, Hashim Warren.</p>



<p>There was a good mix of new feature releases this week, and there's a lot to break down. I think you'll find that the most useful part of today's newsletter is the part where I rework Grafbase's go-to-market.</p>



<p>Let's get into it...</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>Observability platform <strong>Chronosphere</strong> is making moves. </p>



<p>First <a href="https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-acquires-calyptia/">they aquired Calyptia</a>, "a leading provider of observability pipeline solutions."<br><br>Just weeks later <a href="https://chronosphere.io/learn/launchdarkly-is-now-integrated-with-chronosphere-to-enrich-observability-data/">they announced an integration</a> with the most popular release management SaaS, LaunchDarkly.</p>



<p>Chronosphere competes with <strong>New Relic</strong> and <strong>Datadog</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>üèÜPlatform-as-a-Service, <strong>Render</strong> now offers "<a href="https://render.com/blog/high-availability-postgresql">high availability for PostgreSQL</a>". This feature spins up a replica database with automatic failover if your production database hits a problem.</p>



<p>Render only offers high availability for "pro" or paying customers, not on the product's free tier. This type of feature is exactly what a Sales team needs - clear differentiation between pricing tiers with critical features for large customers.</p>



<p>For that, Render earns the "Enterprise Watch" spot this week!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Front-End Products</h2>



<p>‚ú® <strong>Vercel Analytics</strong> has finally become usable, because now it <a href="https://vercel.com/changelog/utm-parameter-support-in-web-analytics">has UTM parameter support</a>. To all of the Marketers and Ad Managers who were forced by the Engineering team to use Vercel Analytics before last week, I feel your pain. </p>



<p>‚ú® Speaking of Vercel, the company's impressive AI builder for UI components has new competition coming. <strong>Builder.io</strong> is launching their own AI-powered tool in less than a month. <a href="https://accelerate.builder.io/">Register for the launch event</a>.</p>



<p>‚ú® <strong>Grafbase</strong> launched <a href="https://grafbase.com/changelog/automatic-persisted-queries">automatic persisted queries</a>, and <a href="https://grafbase.com/changelog/configurable-introspection">configurable introspection</a>. This is on top of the release of federated GraphQL subscriptions, which I covered last week.</p>



<p>Grafbase missed an opportunity by announcing three new features over two weeks. Instead, the team could have won more market attention by weaving a story together about the customer impact of these related changes. That's an attractive angle for a tight "launch week".</p>



<p>Here's how Grafbase could have run a launch week:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Monday</em> - announce the launch week with a name and a theme. Collect prospect emails.</li>



<li><em>Tuesday thru Thursday</em> - roll out the three new features. <a href="https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/9-companies-that-nailed-the-whole-surprise-and-del.html">Surprise and delight</a> email subscribers with branded swag each day.</li>



<li><em>Friday</em> - run a live webinar and demo of each feature. Deliver prospect emails to Sales for follow-up.</li>
</ul>



<p>‚ú® Database service <strong>Planetscale</strong> moved <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/foreign-key-constraints-are-now-generally-available">foreign key constraints to GA</a>. This new feature "can be used to enforce referential integrity in your database."</p>



<p>‚ú® Headless CMS, <strong>Directus</strong> unveiled <a href="https://directus.io/blog/10-9-release-notes">version 10.9</a>. This comes with "new focal point support, a new hash display, a huge bug fix, and a few breaking changes"</p>

<p>No Friday live workshop this week. See you on the next newsletter! - Hashim Warren, Hypeburner.</p>
