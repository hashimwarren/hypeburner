<p>The Thanksgiving holiday didn't slow down the feature releases this week!</p>



<p>Let's get into it...</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>AWS retooled Amplify "to a code-first DX, allowing developers to succinctly express app requirements like data models, business logic, and authorization rules in TypeScript."</p>



<p>Also, the new Amplify enables environments to be managed with git branches: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain">
<p>"all shared environments (such as production, staging, gamma) map 1:1 to Git branches in your repository. New features can be tested in ephemeral environments with pull request previews (or feature branches) before they are merged into production. Unlike the Gen-1 experience, which requires users to configure a number of steps in the CLI or Console to set up a fullstack environment, the Gen-2 experience is zero-config. Because of our code-first approach, the Git repository is always the source of truth for the state of the fullstack app—all backend resources are defined as code for reproducibility and portability across branches."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I personally loved Amplify Console because it made it simply to build and deploy my projects without getting lost in the AWS user interface quagmire. But with this relaunch, it looks like AWS is moving away from Console being the center of Amplify's developer experience, and they now want to enable teams to configure their projects in code, within their projects.</p>



<p>This means Amplify is no longer fighting for dev hearts and minds against Netlify, Vercel, and Render and their kissable UI's. Instead, they want to win against Terraform, Serverless, and Pulumi where all of the app's infrastructure is built, shared, and versioned in code.</p>
