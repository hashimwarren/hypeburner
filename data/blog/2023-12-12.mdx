<p>News hasn't slowed down, even during the middle of December. While some companies are still reeling from layoffs and cutbacks, others are spending money on acquisitions and rolling out new features.</p>



<p>Let's get into it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>The co-founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2023/12/state-of-the-word-2023-recap/">delivered his yearly address</a>, and encouraged WordPress developers to "learn AI deeply". He also previewed upcoming WordPress features. The most exciting for developers are:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51373">Custom Field data in blocks</a>, which is a "last mile" feature for full site editing  </li>



<li><a href="https://wpmovies.dev/">The Interactivity API</a>, which enables instant search and page transitions</li>



<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/">The Data Liberation Project</a>, enabling migrations from popular platforms to WordPress. Interestingly this includes <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/data-liberation/tree/trunk/tools/figma-to-blocks">converting Figma designs into Gutenberg blocks</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It's been some time since I've seen the WordPress community have this much excitement and swagger.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Products Launches</h2>



<p>✨ <a href="https://www.atomicjar.com/2023/12/atomicjar-is-now-part-of-docker/">Docker acquired AtomicJar</a>, which provides a unit-testing framework for containers</p>



<p>✨ <a href="https://vercel.com/changelog/improved-speed-insights-experience">Vercel improved its Speed Insights tool</a> so now you can track Core Web Vitals scores when using any front-end framework, not just Nextjs</p>



<p>✨ Xata, the serverless database <a href="https://xata.io/roadmap#December-10-2023">released an SDK for Go</a><br><br>✨ <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/release-notes/2023-12-04-console">Neon announced a Polyscale integration</a>, which "allows you to easily cache your data globally through its low-latency regional edge network"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>AWS Amplify has a <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSAmplify/status/1734294303814373826">new(ish) integration</a> for Contentful.</p>



<p>Prioritizing this integration for both sides makes sense. Contentful isn't the most innovative headless CMS, but it's the most popular pick by large organizations. And AWS Amplify is not likely more popular than Netlify, but I'm certain it has more enterprise users.</p>



<p>Kudos to those teams. It takes product discipline to focus on integrations with the actual stack of your best paying customers, not just what's broadly popular or innovative.</p>
