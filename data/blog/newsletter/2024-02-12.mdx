This week I profile two new startups that have raised money, and neither has anything to do with AI.

Let's get into it...

Hot Product Launch

Inngest, a platform for running background jobs and workflows just put on a masterclass at winning attention in the market.

First, Inngest launched a slew of new features and integrations. Then they announced $6.1 million funding in a round led by a16z.

A launch week is a tried and true method for making waves in developer communities, and raising capital is the best way to get covered by the tech press.My guess is Inngest closed this round some time ago, and held it for maximum impact. Props to Inngest for weaving both the launch week and fundraising news together.

More Product Launches

✨ Speaking of Inngest, this week the user management platform, Clerk launched a collaboration with that company to enable integrations with external systems.

✨ SST, an infra-as-code project is moving away from AWS' Cloud Formation and Cloud Development Framework (CDK). Instead, the tool is adopting Terraform and Pulumi as dependencies.

This is a massive change that will enable SST to support any cloud provider, not just AWS.✨ Unleash, a feature flag management tool rolled out version 5.9. It comes with enhancements in role-based access control, better feature flag search, and more.

This release is impressive as it's less than a month after v5.8. But the new features almost didn't make it into Hypeburner, since Unleash generated zero attention around it. The tweet announcing 5.9 has no comments or retweets, or even a single "like".

✨ Neurelo, an API gateway just launched out of stealth, with $5 million in funding. The product focuses on serverless app development and claims to solve the issues of cold starts, connection issues, and vendor lock-in.

What can you learn about growing users and revenue from this week's product launches?I'm going live on Friday at 1PM ET/ 10AM PT to show what I would incorporate from these launches, and/or workshop how I would improve them. Register here.See you on Friday!- Hashim Warren, Hypeburner
