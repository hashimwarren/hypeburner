"Devtools Weekly" by Hypeburner tracks the business of developer tools. I'm your editor, Hashim Warren.



This was a busy week, and there were multiple launches this week that could have taken the "Hot Product Launch" spot. 



Let's get into it...



Hot Product Launch



OpenAI revealed v2 of their Assistants API. The updated API gives developers the ability to do "retrieval augmented generation" (RAG) without using third-party tools.



Some are saying OpenAI just knocked over the bird's nest of RAG startups in their incubation stage. This includes LLM orchestrators like Langchain and LlamaIndex, and vector databases like...there are too many to list. 



That take is short-sighted. When a popular platform launches its own tools it typically just validates the need and market. It doesn't wipe out competition.



For example, Terraform usage is surging as a third-party cloud infra tool, despite competing tools maintained by AWS.  







Enterprise Watch



Hyepburner's "Enterprise Watch" is a weekly trophy üèÜ to startups that release features large companies may care about and pay for.



The nod this week goes to testing tool, Cypress with its new org wide reporting features. 



It's remarkable that Cypress is almost 10 years old and only now has this C-suite friendly feature. No matter how long it took, I love seeing this tool make a "pivot to profitability". 







Product Launches



‚ú® SaaS database, Supabase rolled out the general availability of its product after four years in beta. The company also announced an acquisition of Postgres tool Oriole, and that over 1 million databases have been made on the Supabase service.  



‚ú® Neon, a competitor to Supabase also went GA the same day. Neon announced 700,000 databases on the service. 







üìù I'm writing a special report on serverless Postgres databases, which will profile the go-to-market tactics of Supabase, Neon, and more. Keep watching your inbox for a notification of its release.







‚ú® Headless CMS, Contentful launched "Contentful Studio". Contentful Studio is a visual collaboration tool, which is the holy grail for every CMS.



‚ú®Devops platform, Gitlab rolled out Duo Chat, an AI tool that helps with code explanation, refactoring, and test generation.



üí° Here's something to emulate: Gitlab ran a "state of AI in software development" survey and received a ton of earned media from outlets writing about the report. How can you pair original research with upcoming launches to gain PR?



‚ú® Development platform, Render released "protected environments". This ensures that "only admins can perform potentially destructive actions on a protected environment, such as deleting services or modifying environment variables."



I almost gave Render the "Enterprise Watch" üèÜ trophy because of this feature. It's great to see two candidates for the award in the same week.
