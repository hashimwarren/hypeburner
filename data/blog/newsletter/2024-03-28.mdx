"Devtools Weekly" by Hypeburner tracks the business of developer tools. I'm your editor, Hashim Warren.

A lof of solid product news dropped last week. Each one is an example of what to do or not to do when marketing your developer tool.

Let's get into it!

Hot Product Launch

GitHub announced the general availability of Copilot in the CLI. They write that "Copilot in the CLI allows users to access the power of GitHub Copilot to get command suggestions and explanations without leaving the terminal."

That's a bland description of an exciting and powerful new capability. Copilot can now help developers discover and control command line tools, without having to learn the documentation.

Beyond Fireship has a helpful video overview of Copilot in the CLI.

GitHub also published a fantastic "tips & tricks" blog post so that developers can move beyind just using Copilot for simple auto-complete.

Enterprise Watch

Cosmo gets the Enterprise Watch üèÜ this week for achieving SOC-2 compliance.

The team even tells a funny story of how a request from an enterprise customer prompted them to add security to their product roadmap:

"There‚Äôs this start-up moment when you think: all is cool, we‚Äôre onto something, and then there comes this customer asking conversationally: 'ok, all good, just one final tiny request before moving on - could you send over your latest SOC 2 report?' Your response: 'Err‚Ä¶ let me get back to you on that‚Äù. And then, in solitude, you panic.'

Read the entire blog post to understand why Cosmo ignored security as a fast moving startup, and how the needs of one paying customer helped them to get their act together.

Product Launches

‚ú® API gateway, Grafbase introduced Lambda Gateway, "a way to self-host a federated graph in the AWS Lambda platform as a serverless function".

‚ú® Managed database platform, Supabase moved "branching" into public alpha.

This is a catch-up feature for Supabase. Xata has branching and Neon has branching. I love the competition in this space!

‚ú® App platform, Heroku launched single sign-on (SSO) for their low tier, pay-as-you-go customers. Here's a guess on why they made this move. Now that Heroku got rid of the free tier, there was no reason to gate this important feature for just the largest customers.

‚ú® Front-end platform, Vercel rolled our "Next.js AI Chatbot 2.0". This anouncement is a few weeks old, and I skipped it because I thought it was just more AI wow-ware. But I think there's actual innovation here.

This new toolset from Vercel helps developers to add rich components to AI chat, which is usually just text based.

Register for workshop

What can you learn about growing users and revenue from this week's product launches?

I'm going live on Friday at 1PM ET/ 10AM PT to show what I would incorporate from these launches, and workshop how I would improve them.

See you on Friday!

Hashim Warren, Hypeburner
