Yes, I watched the OpenAI announcement. No, it won't be covered in this newsletter.

C'mon, their "dev day" was 90% for consumers. However, I also watched GitHub Universe, and all of GitHub's new features are based on OpenAI tech. So two birds, one stone.

Let's get into it...

Hot Product Launch

GitHub Universe, GitHub annual developer conference announced a lot of new initiatives, mostly focused on AI.

Unfortunately, the tech press coverage missed the most impactful new feature GitHub demo'd - integrations with third-party services through AI chat.

Here are three exciting use cases GitHub highlighted:

Check the status of a feature flag, using LaunchDarkly

Ask Postman if you're using an API correctly

Check the status of a database using Datastax

ðŸ”® Prediction:Today GitHub Copilot promises to help with the consumption of third-party services. But expect discovery, evaluation, procurement, and customer service for devtool services to come next. Trust me - that Octocat will want its tentacles in everything!

Participants in GitHub Copilot's Partner Program: Pulumi, Plotly, Swimm, ReadMe, Gretel, HashiCorp, NowSecure, Split, Microsoft (duh), Trunk, Evinced, Astronomer, Honeycomb, Endor Labs, Octopus Deploy, RedHat, Postman, Databricks, Sentry, Docker, New Relic, Crunch, Datastax, LaunchDarkly, Tricentis, Datadog

Backend Products

âœ¨ Grafbase, the GraphQL API gateway released a Postgres connector. This makes Grafbase easier to use with serverless databases based on Postgres, such as Supabase, Neon, and Railway.

Enterprise Watch

I noticed that for a second year in a row, Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) received a shout out at GitHub Universe for its hockey stick growth in project repos.That's great, but is Hashicorp translating open-source usage of HCL and Terraform into sales?

Hashicorp makes it into Enterprise Watch because on top of the announcement of Terraform's test suite a few weeks ago, they've now released red meat for the Sales team pushing Terraform Enterprise:

Ephemeral workspaces - "set timeouts that automatically destroy temporary resources"

Multiple dynamic provider configurations - "enable workspace admins to authenticate multiple aliases of the same provider within a single workspace when provisioning infrastructure"

Run data retention - "provides a configurable data retention policy for Terraform run data"

Front-End Products

âœ¨ Javascript framework Angular made a splash with a new product direction and new logo to signify a break with the past. Watch the team announce the new features.

DevOps Products

âœ¨ Congrats to the Tabnine team on a $25 million series B! Here's how Tabnine differentiates the tool from GitHub Copilot.

âœ¨ Testing tool Cypress and Currents.dev are knife fighting in public. Here's the side of the story from Currents, and here's the clapback from Cypress. The bigger issue is what should an open-source startup do when a new startup builds a competitive SaaS based on the free project?

Events
