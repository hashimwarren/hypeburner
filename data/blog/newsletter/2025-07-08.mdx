## Launch of the Week

**WorkOS**, the enterprise authentication platform, launched Feature Flags during their Summer Launch Week, expanding beyond authentication into product management territory. The feature lets developers "manage feature access at the org level, assign flags, expose them in JWTs, and roll out features with targeted control."

WorkOS is positioning itself as a comprehensive enterprise product platform. By tying feature flags directly to organization-level permissions and exposing them through JWTs, WorkOS creates a unified control plane that competes directly with LaunchDarkly's core offering.

The strategic implications are significant. WorkOS is betting that enterprises prefer consolidated vendor relationships over managing separate auth and feature flag providers. They can leverage their existing enterprise sales motion to capture market share from companies already using WorkOS for authentication.

## Enterprise Watch üèÜ

**PlanetScale**, the MySQL hosting platform, gets the trophy this week for announcing the private preview of PlanetScale for Postgres with a textbook enterprise product launch. The company is targeting production workloads that demand performance and reliability.

The launch demonstrates impressive enterprise-grade proof points: detailed benchmarks showing performance gains, technical explanations of their scaling mechanisms, and customer quotes from launch partners like Convex. PlanetScale delivered data-driven evidence for why enterprises should switch.

The timing reveals the deeper strategy behind Sam Lambert's recent Twitter feuds. When Lambert [sparred with Neon's CEO](https://x.com/isamlambert/status/1935333197635588393) about production reliability versus developer experience, PlanetScale was already building their Postgres competitor and had secured enterprise customers.

The strategy became clear when Lambert praised Convex's performance after they experienced a service outage (similar to Neon's reliability issues). When I [questioned this contradiction on Twitter](https://hypeburner.com/blog/newsletter/2025-06-23), Lambert's response was telling: "the other service has them daily." This was competitive positioning for a product that was already in development.

PlanetScale's bet is that enterprises will choose proven performance and reliability. With Convex as a launch partner providing real-world validation, they're positioning themselves as the reliable alternative to platforms focused on developer convenience.

**Better Auth**, the open-source authentication framework, raised a $5 million seed round led by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA). The company is betting on a "own your auth" philosophy that offers an alternative to the SaaS-first approach of Auth0 and WorkOS.

Better Auth's strategy involves building both the framework and the infrastructure to support it. They're planning a unified dashboard, enterprise security features, and globally distributed session storage. This hybrid approach of open source framework with paid infrastructure mirrors what companies like Supabase and Planetscale have done successfully.

**Timescale**, the time-series database company, became TigerData in a rebrand that signals their expansion beyond time-series into real-time analytics and AI workloads. The company is positioning itself as "the Modern PostgreSQL for the Analytical and Agentic Era", targeting the growing market of AI applications that need fast data processing.
