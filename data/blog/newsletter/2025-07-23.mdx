## Launch of the Week

**GrowthBook**, the feature flagging platform, launched version 4.0 with a massive array of new features that basically turns it into a full experimentation and insights platform. The standout addition is their SQL Explorer‚Äîa lightweight BI tool that lets you explore data directly within GrowthBook without switching to Looker or similar platforms.

Also notable: GrowthBook shipped their own **MCP server** for AI tools like Cursor. The trend of every developer tool getting an MCP server continues.

## Enterprise Watch üèÜ

**Cloudinary**, the image and video management platform, gets the trophy this week for announcing availability on AWS Marketplace.

It's a little strange though, because the company listed itself as in the "AI Agents and Tools" category.

In any case, the benefit of being on the marketplace isn't discovery, but the ability for customers to purchase and manage Cloudinary services directly through AWS.

## Funding and Acquisitions

**Paddle**, the Merchant of Record platform, raised $25M and made some aggressive expansion moves. The company opened a new Austin office and hired heavy-hitting executives from Shopify, ServiceNow, and Intercom.

What's interesting about Paddle's timing is their bet on web monetization for consumer apps. With Apple's recent policy changes in the U.S. and EU allowing app developers to redirect users to web payments, Paddle is fighting to win those new potention customers.

Paddle wrote, "We are seeing a huge increase in the number of consumer app businesses choosing Paddle to manage their web monetization".

## GTM Trends

**Mux**, the video hosting service, announced their "biggest price drop in history" with a 20% reduction across encoding, storage, and delivery. What's smart about this announcement is how they framed it around infrastructure improvements rather than just competitive pressure.

In the past a startup wouldn't have seen a need to explain a price drop. But now that customers are worrried about the business sustainability of their vendors, it's a good idea to make the reasoning for a price drop clear.

## More Developer Tool News

‚ú® **Zitadel**, the identity management platform, launched a playground for testing authentication flows. This is the kind of developer experience investment that seems small but removes friction from product adoption.

‚ú® **Stytch**, the authentication infrastructure provider, released an MCP server that lets AI agents build enterprise authentication flows directly from tools like Cursor. The demo showed an agent setting up a complete React app with Stytch auth without any dashboard clicking.

‚ú® **Imgix**, the image optimization and delivery service, shipped an AI-Powered creative suite that product and marketing team members can use. The demo images look impressive. But the biggest barrier for Imgix will be changing their positioning from a developer tool to a product that marketers can use without a developer.

‚ú® **Algolia**, the search and discovery platform, made it into Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery.
