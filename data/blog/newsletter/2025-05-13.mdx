## Launch of the week

Figma, the design tool, launched Figma Make, a prompt-to-code tool. Figma Make leaps into a crowded field of AI tools that generate code from design files and prompts, including Vercel's v0, Replit, Lovable, Bolt, and Google's Firebase Studio.

Figma promises that their tool gives uses more precision, and already has the benefit of allowing collaboration through Figma's exisitng features.

I'm bullish on Figma Make, because it is launching with distribution to not just developers and designers, but marketers and product managers.

## Funding & Acquisitions

It's been reported that **OpenAI** has agreed to acquire **Windsurf**, the AI-powered IDE. I've never tried Windsurf, but my feed seems to like Cursor over it. So why didn't OpenAI acquire Cursor? If reports are true, OpenAI approached Cursor first, but they are settling on Cursor.

## More Devtool News

✨ Chroma, the vector database, launched a CLI. The CLI enables users to browse data, create databases, and log into Chroma Cloud from their terminal. Sidenote - I love the minimalist design of Chroma's new website.

✨ Statsig, the experimentation platform, raised a C round for $100 million
at a $1.1 billion valuation. This space is red hot right now. [Datadog acquired](/blog/newsletter/2025-05-05) Statsig's competitor Eppo just the week before.

✨ Netlify, the webapp platform, launched a cache API built entirely "on top of the web standard `Cache` and `CacheStorage` APIs". Netlify explains why this is important by building on web standards, their cache API is more predictable and easy to understand than vendor specific implementations.
