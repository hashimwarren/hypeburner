This was an exciting week! It felt like teams at developer tools companies are finally back to releasing early-and-often after the holiday break. As you'll see, the serverless database, release management, and headless CMS categories were particularly active.

Let's get into it!

Hot Product Launch

Posthog released "feature flag scheduling", allowing teams to "enable, disable, or change the rollout conditions of a flag automatically".

This is an exciting feature for Engineering and Product teams who need to schedule feature releases with Marketing and Sales.

However, it's worth noting that this is a catch-up feature. LaunchDarkly has had scheduling for a long time, though on that platform it's enteprise only.

Enterprise Watch

Feature management platform Statsig gets the Enterprise Watch badgeüéñÔ∏è this week.

The startups's new feature, "organization experiment policy" gives "organization admins unparalleled control and customization capabilities over their experimentation settings." This includes setting and enforcing defaults for new experiments so that users who are not data scientists or experts can use the tool.

Granular access control is a must have for most enteprise customers, but is not often prioritized on the product roadmpap for most developer tools. Props to Statsig's team for shipping this revenue focused feature.

Also, visit thier blog post to see two large, fantastic calls-to-action. One to "create a free account", and one to skip the flirting and "request a demo".

More Product Launches

‚ú® Resend, the developer platform for transactional and marketing emails, launched React Email 2.0. The updated framework comes with new components, a new preview experience, and multiple dx improvements.

‚ú® Serverless database, Neon rolled out their near term roadmap. It includes autoscaling visualizations, feature branch restoration, Vercel integration improvements, and more mature account management.

‚ú® Grafbase, a managed GraphQL API gateway, launched a new security feature. "Operation limits" does what it says, enabling developers to curtail over-bearing API queries.

(I missed this last week, but Grafbase also "introduced joins, which offer a lightweight way to connect your types together in a standalone graph".)

‚ú® Headless CMS, Hygraph now has an app walkthrough in their docs.

This is really smart. Instead of just a text-based tutorial or long demo, they've recorded short videos that showcase key features of the product. This makes it easy to consume for a prospect, and easy to update for the Product team.

‚ú® Another headless CMS, Storyblok partnered with Lokalise for AI-powered translations and localizations.

Events

Trailblazer DX, the Salesforce Developer Conference - March 3-5

State of Open - the UK's open technology conference - February 6-7

What can you learn about growing users and revenue from this week's product launches?I'm going live on Friday at 1PM ET/ 10AM PT to show what I would incorporate from these launches, and/or workshop how I would improve them. These week's example includes a simple SEO change I would make on Statsig's website that would benefit their users and gain more traffic from Google.Register here.See you on Friday!- Hashim Warren, Hypeburner
