"Devtools Weekly" by Hypeburner tracks the business of developer tools. I'm your editor, Hashim Warren.

Happy 2nd quarter kickoff! There was more product news last week than I could cover in one newsletter, so I sifted the most interesting bits and organized it for you. There's a lot we can can learn from this week.

Let's get into it!

Hot Product Launch

Nodejs alternative, Deno launched its own Javascript registry. As a follow-up to the launch, Deno engineers wrote "How We Built JSR".

I call this kind of content "The Factory Tour". It's useful in any industry as a way to fascinate customers and earn trust. However, it's especially effective on developers.

Enterprise Watch

Partnerships are the key to enterprise sales for developer tools. Vector database, Pinecone is demonstrating that in two ways.

First, Pinecone is the #1 most subscribed to product in the AWS marketplace last month, beating out Databricks and MongoDB.

Getting your SaaS listed requires a mature internal process and coordination across Sales, Marketing, and Enginering. However, the payoff is potentially large as you'll be able to close customers who can subscribe using their existing AWS budget, and without having to open a new procurement process.

Vertical partnerships are also important, and Pinecone is investing there, too.The database company announced a partner program. Pinecone partners will enable their customers to launch and eventually mangage the database within their own tools. Langchain, Confluent, and Mistral are in the mix. Pinecone is calling them "the RAG Pack" üòÑ.

Kudos to the Pinecone team for doing the hard job of building partnerships that wins customers. For that, they get the Enterprise Watch üèÜ.

Product Launches

‚ú® App platform, Cloudflare wrapped up "Developer Week" with a rollout of a new SQLite compatible database called D1.

‚ú® React framework, Nextjs announced 1 million monthly active developers. Note that this is Next, not Vercel. As an open source project, I'm not sure how they measure MAU's. Speaking of Vercel...

‚ú® Vercel's CEO led a fantastic demo of "generative UI" at the Google Cloud Next conference. He showed the audience how plain text chat experiences can be extended with rich React components.

‚ú® Headless CMS, Strapi rolled out content release scheduling. Most CMS's enabled editors to schedule a single page. But Strapi lets you schedule multiple pages and pieces of content as a unified release.

‚ú® LLM orchestration framework, Langchain introduced a standardized way to call tools in LLMs. This is the big promise of something like Langchain, that it will keep up with rapidly changing AI services.

Special Report

No webinar this week, but I am working a special report about an exciting category, serverless Postgresql databases. By surveying how these startups are acquiring users in a rapidly evolving market you'll be able to apply these learning to your own products.

See you next week! - Hashim Warren
