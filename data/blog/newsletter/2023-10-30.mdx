Last week was weird!

While some of my friends were navigating yet another round of layoffs, other startups were squeezing in the last bit of productivity before the holiday slowdown. And still others raised a new round of funding.

Let's get into it...

Hot Product Launch

Vercel launches Next.js 14

When I first learned to code I remember how dumb I felt configuring webpack. Then I started using Gatsby and Next.js, which required no webpack config, and I felt like a genius.

But lately…the new features that came with Next 13 made me feel dumb again!

(React Server Components, the App Router, and webpack’s replacement - Turbopack. I didn’t even have the mental model to grok all of these changes.)

Vercel must have been listening to feedback from people like me, because the first thing Guillermo Rauch announced at Next Conf, to laughter and applause, was “No new APIs”. 😀

Instead, Next.js 14 is a stability release, with “server actions” declared stable, and Turbopack updated as almost ready.

So why would they update the version number a whole point, from 13 to 14? My guess - they had a conference to put on, and Morgane Palomares couldn’t let Vercel's biggest sales channel go by without a press worthy update!

Heroku Postgres adds AI capability with pgvector

“we now introduce pgvector, an innovative extension that turns your Heroku Postgres instance into a robust vector database…”

“For AI inference applications, data transformed into its vector representation is called an "embedding". An AI embedding model commonly creates the embeddings. A vector database is a specialized system designed to store these "vectors" or "embeddings". It can quickly find vectors that are close in direction and magnitude across a spectrum of attributes.”

Front-End Products

Stellate drops Cloudflare for Fastly

"When we first built Stellate, no edge computing platform supported all the necessary primitives to build GraphQL edge caching. So, we combined Fastly and Cloudflare to make it work for you. In 2023, this is no longer the case. As of last week, all new Stellate services run entirely on Fastly, improving performance by up to 2x!"

Enterprise Watch

Each week I select news of a developer tool startup who has shown business discipline and taken a step to win large customers.

Sitecore and Netlify Partner Up

The top question for headless Sitecore prospects is likely, “What should I use to deploy my site?”

Netlify probably gets a version of that question from the other side. “What headless CMS should I use?”

This new partnership perhaps makes it easier for Sitecore and Netlify to co-sell their solutions together.
