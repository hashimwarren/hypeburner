## Launch of the Week

**Liveblocks**, the real-time collaboration platform, launched version 3.0 with AI assistants that live inside your product. The startup explains that "AI Copilots are fully integrated collaborators inside your product‚Äîable to understand context, take action, and get things done alongside users." So, originally Liveblocks was about enabling users to collaborate with each other. This expansion is about users collaborating with agents.

What makes this launch impressive is the breadth of use cases they're targeting: in-app support copilots that can take actions for users, onboarding copilots with full context, collaborative writing copilots that work like teammates, and analytics copilots that make data conversational. This is a big leap from the first iteration of companies slapping AI chat in a sidebar and calling it a day.

## Enterprise Watch üèÜ

**PlanetScale** CEO Sam Lambert doubled down on the company's enterprise-first strategy this week, sparking a heated Twitter debate about the future of database infrastructure.

Lambert declared that "PlanetScale is built for production use cases. We are not going to optimize for vibe coding and these 'agentic' development workloads. There are severe trade offs involved and it's not possible to do both."

This was a direct shot at competitors like **Neon**, whose CEO Nikita Shamgunov responded by defending the "vibe coding" trend, arguing that "No one will remember this in a few years as the industry fully transitions to the new way of doing things."

But Lambert clapped back: "if i had your uptime i would not be subtweeting i can tell you that much. get back to your backlog of incident reports."

Lambert looked like a prophet, because two days later Neon experienced a service outage. Oof!

The back and forth highlights a fundamental strategic divide in the database-as-a-service market. PlanetScale is betting that reliability will win, and Neon is betting on accessibility. Lambert's enterprise-first approach is validated every time Neon has reliability issues.

## Funding and Acquisitions

**Polar**, the open-source monetization platform, announced a $10M seed round led by Accel with impressive angel investors including Guillermo Rauch (Vercel), Paul Copplestone (Supabase), and Tobi L√ºtke (Shopify). The company is targeting what they call "one-developer unicorns" - solo builders who need enterprise-grade billing infrastructure.

Their thesis is compelling: "It's never been easier to build software... It's never been easier to ship and scale software. But, it's never been harder to monetize software." Polar is betting that the next wave of unicorns will be built by individual developers who need sophisticated billing without the complexity.

**Browserbase**, the browser infrastructure platform, raised a $40M Series B led by Notable Capital. The company is positioning itself as a primitive for web automation, comparing themselves to foundational companies like Twilio and Stripe. They're also launching Director.ai to make web automation accessible to non-developers, expanding beyond their traditional developer audience.

## More Developer Tool News

‚ú® **Inngest**, the durable workflow platform, launched Realtime in developer preview - a feature that lets you stream updates from functions to users in real-time. The company recognizes that "Realtime updates are now a core requirement for any web application, especially when long-running tasks are involved. The rise of AI patterns such as AI Agents has further emphasized the need for such features."

What's clever about Inngest's approach is the combination of real-time streaming with their existing `waitForEvent()` feature to enable "Human in the Loop" patterns. This lets AI workflows pause for user confirmation before proceeding - a critical capability as AI agents become more autonomous.

‚ú® **Supabase**, the Firebase alternative, released a "Behind The Code" documentary series focusing on the Nuxt.js team. This content marketing play shows how developer tools can create engaging, non-product content that builds community and brand awareness. The documentary format is ambitious and shows Supabase investing heavily in community building beyond just product features.

‚ú® **GrowthBook**, the feature flagging and experimentation platform, launched SQL Explorer as part of their launch month. The tool addresses a common frustration: "answering simple data questions meant jumping into separate tools like Looker, Mode, or Tableau‚Äîjust to write some quick SQL or generate a basic chart." This is smart product expansion - instead of building a full BI platform, they're solving the quick analysis use case that interrupts their core workflow.

GrowthBook's approach of dogfooding their own feature flags for these launches is worth noting - they're not just talking about experimentation, they're living it.
