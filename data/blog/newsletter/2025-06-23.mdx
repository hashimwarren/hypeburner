## Launch of the Week

**Liveblocks**, the real-time collaboration platform, launched version 3.0 with AI assistants that live inside your product. The startup explains that "AI Copilots are fully integrated collaborators inside your product‚Äîable to understand context, take action, and get things done alongside users." So, originally Liveblocks was about enabling users to collaborate with each other. This expansion is about users collaborating with agents.

What makes this launch impressive is the breadth of use cases they're targeting: in-app support copilots that can take actions for users, onboarding copilots with full context, collaborative writing copilots that work like teammates, and analytics copilots that make data conversational. This is a big leap from the first iteration of companies slapping AI chat in a sidebar and calling it a day.

## Enterprise Watch üèÜ

**PlanetScale** CEO Sam Lambert doubled down on the company's enterprise-first strategy this week, sparking a heated Twitter debate about the future of database infrastructure.

The discussion highlights a growing divide in the developer tools space: companies choosing between serving individual developers versus focusing on enterprise customers. PlanetScale's bet on enterprise suggests they see more sustainable revenue in large customer contracts rather than volume-based freemium models.

This strategic pivot is worth watching, especially as other database companies like Neon (recently acquired by Databricks) and Supabase continue to court individual developers and startups.
