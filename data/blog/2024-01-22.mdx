<p>It's a been a month since there's been enough news to fill a devtools weekly newsletter. Let's welcome back all of the Product teams from holiday, and check out what's new... </p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>âœ¨ Netlify released a custom GPT that can deploy your project. Try out "<a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-gkrkrD7PF-website-deployer">Website Deployer</a>" in OpenAI's GPT store.</p>



<p>Gimmick? Not really. The first time I used Netlify was on a page they promoted as a way to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/drop">drag and drop your way</a> to a hosted website. This allowed me to experience the magic of continuous deployment before knowing what that phrase meant. I've been a Netlify user ever since.<br><br>Netlify is giving chatGPT users a seamless way to deploy the tiny websites chatGPT helps them develop. I think it's a another fun, smart go-to-market effort from Netlify. </p>



<p>On top of this launch, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmPPq5Z2css">Netlify recorded a video</a> of how to make your own GPT, using Website Deployer as an example. I like to call this tactic the "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hashimwarren_my-7-favorite-campaigns-for-launching-new-activity-7133961836885938176-8gNt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hashimwarren_my-7-favorite-campaigns-for-launching-new-activity-7133961836885938176-8gNt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">Factory Tour</a>".</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>ðŸ’° Feature management tool Unleash <a href="https://www.getunleash.io/blog/unleash-5-8">released "Private Projects" as part of version 5.8</a>.</p>



<p>What Unleash framed as a "relatively minor release" in the launch blog post is likely being celebrated by their Sales team. Here's why:</p>



<p>"Enterprise users now have the option to set a project to â€˜privateâ€™, which means that people who are not assigned to that project can no longer see this project or its flags. This has been a highly requested option, especially for larger companies and those who manage large amounts of sensitive or confidential data."</p>



<p>This is why Hypeburner has "Enterprise Watch". I want to notice and celebrate any developer tool startup that shows enough focus and product discipline to release features that add value to the paid tier of their SaaS. Props this week to the Unleash team.</p>



<p></p>



<p>ðŸ’° Also props to Contentstack, a headless CMS for <a href="https://twitter.com/Contentstack/status/1745762586740527376">adding their product to the Azure marketplace</a>. </p>



<p>Now prospects who are evaluating Contentstack can run through the procurement process with less hurdles. Some may be able to pay for Contenstack within their existing "cloud" budet without wrangling more approval.</p>



<p>Securing a listing on the AWS, Azure, or GCP marketplace takes prioritized collaboration between Sales, Product, Marketing, and Engineering. (In a former life I did this work for Apollo, so now you can purchase their product through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rql3to5zjpxs2?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa">AWS</a> or <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/apollographql-public/graphos-gcp?project=hopeful-text-226007">Google Cloud</a>). It's not sexy, but it's key to winning more enterprise deals. </p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/contentstackinc1687965149509.contentstack?tab=Overview">See Contentstack's Azure listing</a> </li>



<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-uf2d6fkkohtsc">See Contentstack's AWS listing</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is the first time Enterprise Watch has had two entries in the same week! I hope the trend continues!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Product Launches</h2>



<p>âœ¨ Managed database Convex <a href="https://news.convex.dev/announcing-convex-1-8/" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.convex.dev/announcing-convex-1-8/">dropped version 1.8</a> with an integration for Nextjs' React Server Components. Check out a <a href="https://labs.convex.dev/preloaded-counter">slick demo page</a> of how it works, with <a href="https://github.com/get-convex/preloaded-counter">the source code on Github</a>.</p>



<p>âœ¨ Headless CMS, <a href="https://www.storyblok.com/mp/ecosystem-expanded-netlify">Storyblock announced an integration</a> with Netlify. From their blog post: "The Netlify Builds app can be installed right within Storyblok enabling marketers to self-serve publish as many site changes as they need".</p>



<p>âœ¨ Similarly, AI coding assistant tool <a href="https://codeium.com/blog/mongodb-codeium-partnership-announcement">Codeium anounced their partnership</a> with MongoDB, and <a href="https://codeium.com/blog/atlassian-codeium-announcement">with Atlassian</a>.<br><br>âœ¨ Serverless database Neon premiered <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/bring-your-own-extensions-to-serverless-postgresql">support for PostgreSQL extensions</a>. </p>



<p>This is my first time hearing about Postgres extensions, and Neon's blog post begins with a lengthy and helpful explainer.  Neon should experiement with my favorite "<a href="https://hypeburner.com/seo/" data-type="post" data-id="191">Product-Led SEO</a>" tactic, and create a seperate article that explains Postgres extensions. </p>



<p>The launch post can link to it, so propsects can fully appreciate the feature. But weeks from now, once Google indexes and ranks the page, Neon's definition article may attract new users who are looking to understand extensions.</p>



<p>âœ¨ Adobe's React Aria project <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html#starter-kits">released a component library</a> based on Tailwind. </p>



<p>Wait, how many component projects based on Aria/Tailwind are there? There's <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1747690470065537074">Draft UI, Jolly UI, and Baselayer (thnx Devon Govett)</a>.</p>



<p>Also, Tailwind itself is working on a component library with Aria as a dependency. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/introducing-catalyst">It's called Catalyst</a>.</p>
