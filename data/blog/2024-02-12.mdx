<p>This week I profile two new startups that have raised money, and neither has anything to do with AI. </p>



<p>Let's get into it...</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p><strong>Inngest</strong>, a platform for running background jobs and workflows just put on a masterclass at winning attention in the market.</p>



<p>First, Inngest launched a slew of new features and integrations. Then they announced $6.1 million funding in a round led by a16z.</p>



<p>A launch week is a tried and true method for making waves in developer communities, and raising capital is the best way to get covered by the tech press.<br><br>My guess is Inngest closed this round some time ago, and held it for maximum impact. Props to Inngest for weaving both the launch week and fundraising news together.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">More Product Launches</h2>



<p>✨ Speaking of Inngest, this week the user management platform, <strong>Clerk</strong> <a href="https://clerk.com/blog/clerk-inngest-svix-webhooks">launched a collaboration</a> with that company to enable integrations with external systems.</p>



<p>✨ <strong>SST</strong>, an infra-as-code project is moving away from AWS' Cloud Formation and Cloud Development Framework (CDK). Instead, <a href="https://sst.dev/blog/moving-away-from-cdk.html">the tool is adopting</a> <strong>Terraform</strong> and <strong>Pulumi</strong> as dependencies.</p>



<p>This is a massive change that will enable SST to support any cloud provider, not just AWS.<br><br>✨ <strong>Unleash</strong>, a feature flag management tool <a href="https://www.getunleash.io/blog/unleash-5-9">rolled out version 5.9</a>. It comes with enhancements in role-based access control, better feature flag search, and more.</p>



<p>This release is impressive as it's less than a month after v5.8. But the new features almost didn't make it into Hypeburner, since Unleash generated zero attention around it. The <a href="https://twitter.com/getunleash/status/1752996203472511182">tweet announcing 5.9</a> has no comments or retweets, or even a single "like". </p>



<p>✨ <a href="https://www.neurelo.com/post/neurelo-bridges-the-divide-between-aws-lambda-and-databases"><strong>Neurelo</strong>, an API gateway</a> just launched out of stealth, with <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2024/01/31/neurelo-launches-5m-funding-simplify-database-connectivity-headaches/">$5 million in funding</a>. The product focuses on serverless app development and claims to solve the issues of cold starts, connection issues, and vendor lock-in.</p>
