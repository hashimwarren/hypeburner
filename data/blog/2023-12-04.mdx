<p>This newsletter used to have separate sections for front-end, backend, and devops. But everyone wants to be an all-in-one "platform" now'days, so half of the product launches I featured broke that scheme.</p>



<p>I dumped those headers, and now the newsletter is easier to read, without artificial categories. </p>



<p>Let's get into it...</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>This is a first. Instead of a launch, I'm highlighting an exciting roadmap announcement. Payload CMS is adopting Nextjs as a dependency.</p>



<p>I've read a lot about Payload, and I can't tell what makes the tool different than open-source headless CMS's like Sanity, Strapi, or Hygraph.</p>



<p>Each CMS that I named is straining to make itself as compatible with Nextjs as possible. That's because Next is more than a React framework, it has become a distribution channel for other developer tools. </p>



<p>But "compatibility" for the other CMS's usually means starters and tutorials. Payload is aligning its roadmap to Nextjs, and hoping to become the default option when a developer fires up a new Next app.</p>

<p>✨ <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-insights-anomalies">Planetscale updated its database monitoring tool</a> to include an anomalies section. "There, you’ll find a graph representing your database’s health over time, as measured by the number of queries that took longer than expected." </p>

<p>✨ <a href="https://twitter.com/kiwicopple/status/1729836290751754604">Supabase made a dx improvement</a> to their CLI, "using the browser instead of copying the API keys from the dashboard manually". The lead engineer on this feature offers a walk-thru of how he implemented it. </p>

You explain the unique benefits of a feature or product by showing how its made. More devtools startups should consider adding Factory Tours in their go-to-market toolkit.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>✨ The Heroku sales team is <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/heroku-in-aws-marketplace">all smiles today</a> - "we’re excited to announce that Heroku is available for purchase in AWS Marketplace through the Private Offers program".</p>



<p>Now prospects can quickly pay for Heroku out of their firm's existing AWS/cloud budget, instead of running it through a long procurement process.</p>
