<p class="has-base-color has-contrast-2-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-medium-font-size">"<strong>Devtools Weekly</strong>" by <a href="https://hypeburner.com">Hypeburner</a> tracks the business of developer tools. I'm your editor, Hashim Warren.</p>



<p></p>



<p>A lot of new features and pricing changes happened in our industry this week, leaving a good bit for us to explore. </p>



<p>Let's get into it!</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p>Serverless database, <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/changelog/2024-02-23-console">Neon announced an exciting feature</a> that "restores a branch to an earlier state in its own or another branch's history."<br><br>Officially Neon calls it "Branch restore with Time Travel Assist", which sounds like an offensive play the Lakers might run. </p>



<p>Seriously though, the Neon team is doing impressive work with bringing familiar version controls to database management. This new feature is easily the Hot Launch of the week.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, out of everything I saw launched last week by developer tools startups, I wouldn't classify any of it as being aimed at winning large customers. </p>



<p>Hopefully some Product team will try to increase revenue next week!</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Front-End Products</h2>



<p>✨ Headless CMS, <strong>Strapi</strong> <a href="https://strapi.io/blog/new-developer-plan">added a $29 plan</a>, hoping to entice developers to use the service for their side projects.</p>



<p>✨ API gateway, <strong>Grafbase</strong> continues its drumbeat of new releases with <a href="https://grafbase.com/changelog/batching">the announcement of "batching"</a>, which "allows users to make multiple independent GraphQL requests in a single HTTP request."</p>



<p>Serverless database, <strong>Xata</strong> <a href="https://xata.io/roadmap#February-21-2024">now has previews</a> for audio and video attachments in the database. This makes Xata even more attractive and usable to the non-database managers on a team. </p>



<p>(Sidenote - Xata combines its <a href="https://xata.io/roadmap">product roadmap and changelog</a> on the same page. It's a smart presentation that all developer tool SaaS companies should consider adopting.)</p>



<p>✨ New React framework <strong>Waku</strong> is <a href="https://developers.netlify.com/guides/using-waku-on-netlify-for-react-server-components/">now supported on Netlify</a>. </p>



<p>✨ <strong>Heroku</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB0V8wWsCsc">released a "What is Heroku?"</a> demo video that walks through the basics of the app platform.</p>



<p>Let's learn from this one. Why would Heroku, which has been around 17 years and has high brand recognition amongst web developers spend time making a "Heroku 101" video?</p>



<p>It's because the team there understands what I also advise to devtool startups. The most urgent need for your SaaS is for prospects and free tier users to understand the basic value and differentiator of your tool. </p>



<p>Because of this I suggest a monthly, or even weekly live demo of your core features.</p>
