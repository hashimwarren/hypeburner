<p>This was an exciting week! It felt like teams at developer tools companies are finally back to releasing early-and-often after the holiday break. <br><br>As you'll see, the <em>serverless database</em>, <em>release management</em>, and <em>headless CMS</em> categories were particularly active.</p>



<p>Let's get into it! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Hot Product Launch</h2>



<p><strong>Posthog</strong> released "<a href="https://posthog.com/changelog/2024#feature-flag-scheduling-released">feature flag scheduling</a>", allowing teams to "enable, disable, or change the rollout conditions of a flag automatically".</p>



<p>This is an exciting feature for Engineering and Product teams who need to schedule feature releases with Marketing and Sales. </p>



<p>However, it's worth noting that this is a catch-up feature. <strong>LaunchDarkly</strong> has had <a href="https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/scheduled-changes">scheduling</a> for a long time, though on that platform it's enteprise only. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">Enterprise Watch</h2>



<p>Feature management platform <strong>Statsig</strong> gets the <em>Enterprise Watch</em> badgeüéñÔ∏è this week. </p>



<p>The startups's new feature, "<a href="https://statsig.com/blog/organization-experiment-policy" data-type="link" data-id="https://statsig.com/blog/organization-experiment-policy">organization experiment policy</a>" gives "organization admins unparalleled control and customization capabilities over their experimentation settings." This includes setting and enforcing defaults for new experiments so that users who are not data scientists or experts can use the tool.</p>



<p>Granular access control is a must have for most enteprise customers, but is not often prioritized on the product roadmpap for most developer tools. Props to Statsig's team for shipping this revenue focused feature.</p>



<p>Also, visit thier blog post to see two large, fantastic calls-to-action. One to "create a free account", and one to skip the flirting and "request a demo". </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-base-2-background-color has-background">More Product Launches</h2>



<p>‚ú® <strong>Resend</strong>, the developer platform for transactional and marketing emails, launched <a href="https://resend.com/blog/react-email-2">React Email 2.0</a>. The updated framework comes with new components, a new preview experience, and multiple dx improvements.</p>



<p>‚ú® Serverless database, <strong>Neon</strong> rolled out <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/roadmap">their near term roadmap</a>. It includes autoscaling visualizations, feature branch restoration, Vercel integration improvements, and more mature account management. </p>



<p>‚ú® <strong>Grafbase</strong>, a managed GraphQL API gateway, launched a new security feature. "<a href="https://grafbase.com/changelog/operation-limits">Operation limits</a>" does what it says, enabling developers to curtail over-bearing API queries.</p>



<p>(I missed this last week, but <a href="https://grafbase.com/changelog/joining-data-sources">Grafbase also</a> "introduced joins, which offer a lightweight way to connect your types together in a standalone graph".)</p>



<p>‚ú® Headless CMS, <strong>Hygraph</strong> now has an <a href="https://hygraph.com/docs/getting-started/fundamentals/app-walkthrough">app walkthrough in their docs</a>. </p>



<p>This is really smart. Instead of just a text-based tutorial or long demo, they've recorded short videos that showcase key features of the product. This makes it easy to consume for a prospect, and easy to update for the Product team. </p>



<p>‚ú® Another headless CMS, Storyblok <a href="https://www.storyblok.com/mp/storyblok-partners-with-lokalise">partnered with Lokalise</a> for AI-powered translations and localizations.</p>
